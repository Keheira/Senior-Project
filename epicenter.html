    <h1>Earthquake Epicenter</h1>
        <h4 align="left">Introduction</h4>
        <p>An earthquake epicenter is the point on the Earth's surface directly above the earthquake focus. The epicenter is the geographical location of the earthquake reported on television stations and written reports about earthquakes.</p>

        <h4 align="left">Epicenter of an earthquake</h4>
        <p>The point where the rocks actually break is the earthquake focus. Large subduction zone earthquakes can break along a fault for hundreds of kilometer. The epicenter of these earthquakes is directly above where the earthquake actually started along the fault line.</p>
    <h4 align="left">Destruction at the epicenter</h4>
        <p>The amount of destruction at the epicenter of an earthquake is directly affected by its size and the depth where the rocks rupture. The epicenter of an earthquake is the same whether the rocks ruptured at 50 kilometers, 100 kilometers or even 300 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface.</p>
